# Completed Tasks Summary: Enhanced Error Handling for Niagara Parser

## Overview

This document summarizes the successful completion of the remaining error handling tasks (1.4.2, 1.4.3, and 1.4.4) for the Niagara lunch parser enhancement project.

## ✅ Task 1.4.2: Handle cases where expected elements are missing

**Status: COMPLETED**

### Implementation Details

The parser now gracefully handles all missing element scenarios:

1. **Missing main container**: Falls back to `body` selector and continues processing
2. **Missing tables**: Automatically tries modern structure extraction when no tables found
3. **Missing table cells**: Validates cell count and skips rows with insufficient data
4. **Missing week element**: Uses fallback week calculation based on current date
5. **Empty elements**: Detects completely empty containers and returns empty results

### Evidence of Completion

- All 5 test scenarios pass without throwing errors
- Parser continues execution even when expected elements are missing
- Graceful degradation in all failure scenarios
- Comprehensive logging explains what elements are missing and what fallbacks are used

## ✅ Task 1.4.3: Add validation for extracted data before adding to lunches array

**Status: COMPLETED**

### Implementation Details

1. **Created comprehensive data validator** (`data-validator.mjs`):
   - Swedish weekday validation (måndag, tisdag, onsdag, torsdag, fredag)
   - Price validation (must be valid number ≥ 0)
   - Week validation (must be number 1-53)
   - String validation for name and place
   - Complete lunch object validation

2. **Enhanced price extraction logic**:
   - Returns `null` for invalid prices instead of defaulting to 0
   - Validates extracted prices before accepting them
   - Stricter pattern matching for price formats

3. **Integrated validation into extraction process**:
   - All extracted lunches are validated using `validateLunches()`
   - Invalid lunch objects are filtered out before returning
   - Validation results are logged for debugging

### Evidence of Completion

- All 4 test scenarios pass validation requirements
- Invalid data (missing names, invalid prices) is correctly filtered out
- Valid data passes through unchanged
- Mixed valid/invalid data scenarios handled correctly (extracts only valid items)

## ✅ Task 1.4.4: Log meaningful error messages for debugging

**Status: COMPLETED**

### Implementation Details

The parser now provides comprehensive, contextual logging for all scenarios:

1. **Restaurant closure detection**:
   ```
   Restaurant status check: Restaurant appears closed: semesterstängt, semester, stängt, vacation week pattern detected
   This is expected behavior when restaurant is closed for vacation or maintenance
   ```

2. **Missing elements scenarios**:
   ```
   No tables found in container - will try modern structure extraction
   No modern structure indicators found - lunch data may be in unexpected format
   No content elements found for måndag in modern structure
   ```

3. **Data extraction failures**:
   ```
   Failed to extract valid lunch data from row for måndag
   Table row for måndag missing required cells (has 1, needs 3)
   ```

4. **Validation and results**:
   ```
   Validating 1 extracted lunch items...
   === Validation Results for Niagara ===
   Total lunches processed: 1
   Valid lunches: 1
   Invalid lunches: 0
   ```

5. **Status reporting**:
   ```
   Successfully extracted and validated 1 lunch items from Niagara
   No lunch data extracted - this may be normal if restaurant is closed or has no current menu
   ```

### Evidence of Completion

- **Meaningful context**: All log messages include restaurant name, operation details, and specific error context
- **Debugging information**: Clear indication of what went wrong and why
- **Status explanations**: Explains when empty results are expected vs. unexpected
- **Validation details**: Shows validation counts and specific error types
- **Process flow**: Logs show the decision tree and fallback strategies

## Key Enhancements Made

### 1. Restaurant Status Detection
- Added `validateRestaurantStatus()` function to detect closure keywords
- Handles Swedish vacation patterns (V.29-32), semester closure, and limited service
- Provides informative logging when restaurant is closed

### 2. Robust Data Validation
- Created comprehensive validation framework with specific Swedish requirements
- Validates all data types before inclusion in results
- Provides detailed validation reporting

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks around all critical operations
- Fallback strategies for missing elements
- Graceful degradation with informative logging

### 4. Improved Price Extraction
- Stricter validation of price data
- Better pattern matching for Swedish currency formats
- Rejection of invalid prices rather than defaulting to 0

## Real-World Testing

The enhanced parser has been tested against the live Niagara website during their vacation closure:

```bash
$ node local-test-server.js
Starting lunch extraction from Niagara: https://restaurangniagara.se/lunch/
Found container with selector: main
Restaurant status check: Restaurant appears closed: semesterstängt, semester, stängt, vacation week pattern detected
This is expected behavior when restaurant is closed for vacation or maintenance
```

This demonstrates that the parser correctly:
- Detects the vacation closure
- Provides clear explanation of the situation
- Returns empty results gracefully
- Logs meaningful information for debugging

## Next Steps

With tasks 1.4.2, 1.4.3, and 1.4.4 now complete, the project is ready to proceed to:

- **Task 1.5**: Create unit tests for updated Niagara parser
- **Task 2.0**: Implement Core Infrastructure and Architecture

The Niagara parser now has comprehensive error handling, robust data validation, and meaningful logging that will serve as a solid foundation for the multi-restaurant architecture phase.

## Files Modified/Created

- `data-validator.mjs` - New comprehensive validation framework
- `data-extractor.mjs` - Enhanced with validation and error handling
- `test-enhanced-error-handling.mjs` - Comprehensive test suite
- `test-task-completion.mjs` - Task verification tests

The error handling implementation is now production-ready and provides excellent debugging capabilities for future development and maintenance.
