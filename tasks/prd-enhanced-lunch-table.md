# Product Requirements Document: Enhanced Lunch Table

## Introduction/Overview

The Enhanced Lunch Table is an evolution of the existing lunch aggregation system that currently fetches and displays lunch menus from restaurants. The current implementation suffers from slow page loads due to real-time data fetching and lacks scalability for multiple restaurants. This enhancement will introduce a robust caching architecture, support for 8 restaurants, multi-day browsing capabilities, and an extensible parser system to create a fast, reliable lunch discovery platform.

The primary problem this enhancement solves is the poor user experience caused by slow page loads and the inability to scale the current architecture to multiple restaurants while maintaining performance.

## Goals

1. **Performance**: Reduce page load times from several seconds to under 1 second through intelligent caching
2. **Scalability**: Support 8 restaurants without performance degradation
3. **Reliability**: Implement graceful fallback mechanisms when restaurant data is unavailable
4. **Maintainability**: Create an extensible system that makes adding new restaurants straightforward
5. **Monitoring**: Provide basic error logging for debugging and maintenance

## User Stories

1. **As a lunch seeker**, I want to quickly see today's lunch options from multiple restaurants so that I can make a fast decision about where to eat.

2. **As a lunch planner**, I want to browse lunch menus for different days of the week so that I can plan my meals in advance.

3. **As a user during peak lunch hours**, I want the application to load quickly even when restaurant websites are slow or unavailable so that I don't waste time waiting.

4. **As a user**, I want to see what lunch information is available even if some restaurants haven't updated their menus so that I can still make informed decisions.

5. **As a developer maintaining the system**, I want clear error logs when data fetching fails so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Background Data Collection**: The system must run a scheduled background job that fetches lunch data from all configured restaurants and stores it in a cache.

2. **Fast Data Serving**: The main Lambda function must serve cached data to users with sub-second response times.

3. **Multi-Day Support**: The system must allow users to browse lunch menus for the current week (Monday through Friday only, no weekend data).

4. **Weekly Data Collection**: The system must run a scheduled weekly data collection job every Monday at 10:00 UTC to fetch fresh lunch menus for the week.

5. **Manual Cache Refresh**: The system must provide a manual trigger to refresh data on-demand for testing and emergency updates.

6. **Fallback Mechanism**: When fresh data cannot be fetched, the system must serve the most recent cached data available for each restaurant.

7. **Restaurant Support**: The system must support the following 8 restaurants:
   - Niagara (partially implemented)
   - ICA Maxi Västra Hamnen
   - Välfärden
   - Mia Maria's
   - Stora Varvsgatan 6
   - Saltimporten
   - Kolga
   - Ubåtshallen
   - Eatery Västra Hamnen

8. **Restaurant Parser Framework**: The system must provide a standardized interface for adding new restaurant data parsers that makes implementing new parsers straightforward.

9. **Error Handling**: The system must log basic errors when data fetching fails without exposing technical details to end users.

10. **Empty Data Display**: The system must display empty cells in the table when specific data points are unavailable.

11. **Cache Status Indication**: The system should indicate when data was last updated for transparency.

12. **Graceful Degradation**: The system must continue to function and display available data even when some restaurants are unreachable.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Weekend Data**: The system will not collect or display weekend lunch data as restaurants do not offer daily lunches on weekends.

2. **User Accounts**: No user authentication, personalization, or saved preferences.

3. **Location-Based Restaurant Discovery**: The restaurant list will be fixed and not based on user location.

4. **Advanced Analytics**: No detailed usage analytics or performance monitoring beyond basic error logging.

5. **Mobile App**: This enhancement focuses on the web interface only.

6. **Restaurant Rating/Reviews**: No user-generated content or rating systems.

7. **Price Comparison Features**: No advanced price analysis or recommendation algorithms.

8. **Multi-Language Support**: Swedish only, no internationalization.

9. **Advanced Filtering**: Beyond the existing TUI Grid filters, no complex search functionality.

## Design Considerations

- **Data Structure**: Maintain the existing lunch object structure for backward compatibility
- **Error States**: Subtle indicators for restaurants with stale or missing data

## Technical Considerations

- **Architecture**: Implement a two-Lambda approach - one for background data collection, one for serving cached data
- **Caching Storage**: Use DynamoDB for persistent caching with TTL (Time To Live) settings
- **Scheduling**: Use AWS EventBridge to trigger weekly data collection every Monday at 10:00 UTC
- **Manual Triggers**: Implement manual refresh capability for testing and emergency updates
- **Parser Interface**: Create an abstract base class or interface for restaurant parsers to ensure consistency
- **Error Handling**: Implement circuit breaker pattern for unreliable restaurant websites
- **Dependencies**: Maintain existing dependencies (JSDOM, TUI Grid) while adding AWS SDK for DynamoDB operations
- **Local Development**: Ensure the local test server can work with mock cached data for development
- **Deployment**: This will be a completely new deployment with no existing system to maintain

## Success Metrics

1. **Page Load Time**: Reduce average page load time to under 1 second (from current 3-5 seconds)
2. **Data Freshness**: Achieve 95% success rate in weekly data collection across all 8 restaurants
3. **System Reliability**: Maintain 99% uptime for the serving Lambda function
4. **Error Reduction**: Reduce user-facing errors by 90% through proper fallback mechanisms
5. **Developer Productivity**: Enable addition of new restaurants within 1 hour of development time
6. **Weekly Coverage**: Successfully collect and display lunch data for all weekdays (Monday-Friday)

## Implementation Notes

Based on clarifications provided:

1. **Restaurant List**: The system will support 8 restaurants including Niagara (already implemented) plus 7 additional restaurants: ICA Maxi, Välfärden, Mia Maria's, Stora Varvsgatan 6, Saltimporten, Kolga, Ubåtshallen, and Eatery Västra Hamnen.

2. **Data Collection Schedule**: Weekly data collection will run every Monday at 10:00 UTC to capture fresh lunch menus for the week.

3. **Weekend Handling**: No weekend data will be collected or displayed as restaurants do not offer daily lunches on weekends.

4. **Manual Refresh**: A manual trigger for on-demand data refresh will be implemented for testing and emergency updates.

5. **Cost Considerations**: AWS costs are not a primary concern and the architecture should prioritize functionality over cost optimization.

6. **Deployment Strategy**: This will be deployed as a completely new system with no existing deployment to consider.

## Remaining Open Questions

1. **Parser Priority**: Which restaurants should be prioritized for implementation after Niagara?
2. **Error Notification**: Should there be any alerting mechanism for failed data collection jobs?
3. **Data Validation**: What level of data validation should be implemented for parsed restaurant data?
