## Notes

- Just fetching index.html and not anything else will be enough one some sites
- Some sites may fetch menu data as separate request that can be done immediately without parsing the site
- Might need dom parser to help with data extraction?
- Might need logic on when to scrape a site, too often or regular might be blocked?


## TODO

- Do a client only solution
- Consider doing a service that caches data to not overwhelm sites
