# Product Requirements Document: Enhanced Lunch Table

## Introduction/Overview

The Enhanced Lunch Table is an evolution of the existing lunch aggregation system that currently fetches and displays lunch menus from restaurants. The current implementation suffers from slow page loads due to real-time data fetching and lacks scalability for multiple restaurants. This enhancement will introduce a robust caching architecture, support for multiple restaurants, and an extensible parser system to create a fast, reliable lunch discovery platform.

The primary problem this enhancement solves is the poor user experience caused by slow page loads and the inability to scale the current architecture to multiple restaurants while maintaining performance.

## Goals

1. **Performance**: Reduce page load times from several seconds to under 1 second through intelligent caching
2. **Scalability**: Support 5-10 restaurants without performance degradation
3. **Reliability**: Implement graceful fallback mechanisms when restaurant data is unavailable
4. **Maintainability**: Create an extensible system that makes adding new restaurants straightforward
5. **Monitoring**: Provide basic error logging for debugging and maintenance

## User Stories

1. **As a lunch seeker**, I want to quickly see today's lunch options from multiple restaurants so that I can make a fast decision about where to eat.

2. **As a lunch planner**, I want to browse lunch menus for different days of the week so that I can plan my meals in advance.

3. **As a user during peak lunch hours**, I want the application to load quickly even when restaurant websites are slow or unavailable so that I don't waste time waiting.

4. **As a user**, I want to see what lunch information is available even if some restaurants haven't updated their menus so that I can still make informed decisions.

5. **As a developer maintaining the system**, I want clear error logs when data fetching fails so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Background Data Collection**: The system must run a scheduled background job that fetches lunch data from all configured restaurants and stores it in a cache.

2. **Fast Data Serving**: The main Lambda function must serve cached data to users with sub-second response times.

3. **Multi-Day Support**: The system must allow users to browse lunch menus for the current week (Monday through Friday).

4. **Cache Management**: The system must refresh cached data at least weekly and maintain data until the next week.

5. **Cache Update Trigger**: When fresh data is not in cache, the system should trigger data collection for the missing restaurants.

6. **Restaurant Parser Framework**: The system must provide a standardized interface for adding new restaurant data parsers.

7. **Error Handling**: The system must log basic errors when data fetching fails without exposing technical details to end users.

8. **Empty Data Display**: The system must display empty cells in the table when specific data points are unavailable.

9. **Restaurant Management**: The system must support 5-10 restaurants with the ability to easily add or remove restaurants from the configuration.

10. **Cache Status Indication**: The system should indicate when data was last updated for transparency.

11. **Graceful Degradation**: The system must continue to function and display available data even when some restaurants are unreachable.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **User Accounts**: No user authentication, personalization, or saved preferences.

2. **Location-Based Restaurant Discovery**: The restaurant list will be fixed and not based on user location.

3. **Advanced Analytics**: No detailed usage analytics or performance monitoring beyond basic error logging.

4. **Mobile App**: This enhancement focuses on the web interface only.

5. **Restaurant Rating/Reviews**: No user-generated content or rating systems.

6. **Price Comparison Features**: No advanced price analysis or recommendation algorithms.

7. **Multi-Language Support**: Swedish only, no internationalization.

8. **Advanced Filtering**: Beyond the existing TUI Grid filters, no complex search functionality.

## Design Considerations

- **Data Structure**: Maintain the existing lunch object structure for backward compatibility
- **Error States**: Subtle indicators for restaurants with stale or missing data

## Technical Considerations

- **Architecture**: Implement a two-Lambda approach - one for background data collection, one for serving cached data
- **Caching Storage**: Use DynamoDB for persistent caching with TTL (Time To Live) settings
- **Scheduling**: Use AWS EventBridge or CloudWatch Events for daily data collection jobs
- **Parser Interface**: Create an abstract base class or interface for restaurant parsers to ensure consistency
- **Error Handling**: Implement circuit breaker pattern for unreliable restaurant websites
- **Dependencies**: Maintain existing dependencies (JSDOM, TUI Grid) while adding AWS SDK for DynamoDB operations
- **Local Development**: Ensure the local test server can work with mock cached data for development

## Success Metrics

1. **Page Load Time**: Reduce average page load time to under 1 second (from current 3-5 seconds)
2. **Data Freshness**: Achieve 95% success rate in daily data collection across all restaurants
3. **System Reliability**: Maintain 99% uptime for the serving Lambda function
4. **Error Reduction**: Reduce user-facing errors by 90% through proper fallback mechanisms
5. **Developer Productivity**: Enable addition of new restaurants within 1 hour of development time

## Open Questions

1. **Restaurant List**: What are the specific 5-10 restaurants you want to include initially?
2. **Data Collection Timing**: What time of day should the background job run to capture fresh lunch menus?
3. **Weekend Handling**: Should the system display weekend data or only weekdays?
4. **Cache Warming**: Should there be a manual trigger to refresh data on-demand for testing purposes?
5. **Cost Considerations**: What are the acceptable AWS costs for the enhanced architecture?
6. **Deployment Strategy**: Should this be deployed alongside the existing system or as a replacement?
